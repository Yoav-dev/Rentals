1.	Several options for servers frameworks are:
	a.	javax.servlet package - with base Servlet interface
	b.	spring framework - with @RestController annotation
2.	I chose to use spring framework - because it has become the standard, and uses annotations rather than xml conf (in javax.servlet package) - which is much more readable.
